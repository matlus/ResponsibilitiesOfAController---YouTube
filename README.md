[![ASP.NET Core - Responsibilities Of a Controller](http://img.youtube.com/vi/uP0lM8Cx8I8/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP0lM8Cx8I8 "ASP.NET Core - Responsibilities Of a Controller")

What are the roles and responsibilities of a Controller (Web API/MVC)? Controllers are part of the “Service Interface Layer”, so what are the roles and responsibilities of the service interface layer then? In this video and walk you through building a simple application and explain by way of demonstration what your controllers should and shouldn’t do.
Additionally, we use a custom ActionResult descendant in this project, so you’ll also learn about ActionResult and how they work and when and how to make your own custom ActionResult descendants.
The code the this project can be found on my GitHub
